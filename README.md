<h1> Joe Stakey's solutions</h1>
My solutions to [@tinchoabbate](https://twitter.com/tinchoabbate) 's damnvulnerabledefi.xyz Solidity challenges.
The solutions scripts are in the **test** directory.
For some challenges, an external Solidity contract was created to perform the attack. You will find these contracts in **contracts/attacker-contracts**
The scripts and contracts contain comments explaining how the attack was set up.
