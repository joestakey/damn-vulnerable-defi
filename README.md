<h1> Joe Stakey's solutions</h1>
My solutions to <a href="https://twitter.com/tinchoabbate">@tinchoabbate</a>'s <a href="https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/index.html">damnvulnerabledefi.xyz</a> Solidity challenges.<br>
The solutions scripts are in the <b>test</b> directory.<br>
For some challenges, an external Solidity contract was created to perform the attack. You will find these contracts in <b>contracts/attacker-contracts</b>.<br>
The scripts and contracts contain comments explaining how the attack was set up.
